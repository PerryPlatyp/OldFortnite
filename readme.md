## Installation

### Fortnite Build

Go to https://github.com/notsamicc/Fortnite-Builds and select which one you want to download.

We're playing 5.41 so download that one.

Once downloaded, Extract it.
Next open the extracted folder until you get to a folder containing 2 other folders called Engine and FortniteGame

Keep the path to that folder memorized, You'll need it later.

### Project Reboot (Launcher)

Go to https://discord.gg/reboot and join the server.

Go to the #launcher section in the server and download Release 6.4. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE CLI. Download the one that says reboot_launcher-6.4.06.4.0-windows-setup.exe.

Once launched it will take you to a setup. You may need to turn off your antivirus because Project Reboot uses a DLL Injector. Basically it injects a dll so you are able to use a console in fortnite. It does not harm your PC but if you don't trust it please view the code at this link: https://github.com/Lawin0129/LawinServer.

### Disable Windows Defender
Open start and search for "Windows Security"
Once there, look under Virus & threat protection settings.
There will be a link under it called "Manage Settings". Click it.
Turn off Real-time Protection and press "Yes" to the dialog that pops up.

### Launch Project Reboot
Go to your desktop and open Project Reboot.

Change your name to any name you like. It doesn't matter. You don't need the same username as your normal Epic Games account.

Next go to the Version section. Click on the button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus icon on it. 
First type the version number of the version you downloaded. For us it will be 5.41
Next click the folder icon and find the path that you remembered from earlier. The one with 2 folders in it called Engine and FortniteGame. Once you see those 2 folders click OK and then click Save in Project Reboot.

Next select the version you want to play and make sure "Client" is selected on the type section.

Finally click Launch.

If it asks you if you want to start a server click ignore as you are not hosting a server. You are joining one.

Fortnite should be launching.

Once you see the game select click on Battle Royale.

After you are in the lobby please go on to the join a server section.

### Join a server

Once you are in the lobby press the Tilde key. It is right next to the 1 key and has a (~) icon on it. You should see a black bar at the bottom of your screen.

To join a server you will need the IP Address of the hosting server. Once you have it type "open <IPADDRESS>"
Do not put the <> as I did.

You should be joining!

Done!
